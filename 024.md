# Missing Storage Gap in `Emission.sol` contract which is Upgradeable Contract

## Summary
The Emission.sol contract inherits from OwnableUpgradeable but does not include a reserved storage space (__gap) to ensure future compatibility with upgrades.

## Vulnerability Detail
Lack of reserved storage space in an upgradeable contract.

If Protocol team deploys the Emission contract as part of an upgradable system. And If the contract is upgraded to a new version that adds new state variables. Without the reserved storage gap, the new state variables could overwrite or misalign with the existing storage layout, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential loss of data integrity.

And Without this gap, any protocol built on top of this Mento Protocol, leveraging the `Emission` contract could face severe issues during an upgrade.

## Impact
Future upgrades to the Emission contract could cause storage collisions, leading to critical issues such as loss of funds, corruption of the contract state, and leading similar problems to the protocol's contract built on top of it.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The standard practice is to use a uint256[50] private __gap; at the end of the contract's storage variables.
