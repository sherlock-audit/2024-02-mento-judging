# Unchecked return value of `mint` function in `Emission.sol` contract can lead to loss of funds

**Bug Report:**

**Summary:**

Unchecked return value of `mint` function in `Emission.sol` contract can lead to loss of funds.

**Vulnerability Detail:**
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-mento/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/governance/Emission.sol#L84-L92
The `Emission.sol` contract uses the `mint` function of the `MentoToken` contract to emit tokens. However, the [`emitTokens`](#https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-mento/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/governance/Emission.sol#L84-L92) function in the `Emission.sol` contract calls the `mint` function without checking its return value. This can potentially lead to issues if the `mint` function fails for any reason, such as due to a lack of permissions or an overflow. If the `mint` function fails, the `Emission` contract would not be aware of the failure, and the tokens would not be emitted as expected. This can result in a loss of funds.

**Impact:**

If the `mint` function of the `MentoToken` contract fails, the `Emission` contract would not be aware of the failure, and the tokens would not be emitted as expected, resulting in a loss of funds.

**Code Snippet:**
```scss
function emitTokens() external returns (uint256 amount) {
    amount = calculateEmission();
    require(amount > 0, "Emission: no tokens to emit");

    totalEmittedAmount += amount;

    emit TokensEmitted(emissionTarget, amount);
    mentoToken.mint(emissionTarget, amount);
}
```
**Tool used:**

Manual Review

**Recommendation:**

The `emitTokens` function in the `Emission.sol` contract should be modified to check the return value of the `mint` function. Here's an example of how the `emitTokens` function can be modified to include this check:
```solidity
function emitTokens() external returns (uint256 amount) {
    amount = calculateEmission();
    require(amount > 0, "Emission: no tokens to emit");

    totalEmittedAmount += amount;

    // Check the return value of the mint function
    bool success = mentoToken.mint(emissionTarget, amount);
    require(success, "Emission: minting failed");

    emit TokensEmitted(emissionTarget, amount);
}
```
In this modified version, the `require` statement checks the return value of the `mint` function. If the `mint` function fails, the `require` statement will cause the transaction to revert, preventing the loss of funds.

It's important to note that the actual implementation of the `mint` function in the `MentoToken` contract must also be secure and return a value indicating success or failure. If the `mint` function does not return a value, the `require` statement in the `Emission` contract will not be able to check for success or failure, and the potential issue will remain.

**Severity:**

High - Loss of funds can occur if the `mint` function fails and the `Emission` contract does not revert the transaction.
