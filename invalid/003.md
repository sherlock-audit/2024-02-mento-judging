# There's no check in Emission.emitTokens() to ensure that `totalEmittedAmount` doesn't out grow `emissionSupply`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
`emissionSupply` is the max amount that will be minted through emission in Emission.sol

Now the issue is that in Emission.emitTokens() there's no check to ensure that `totalEmittedAmount` which is the cumulative amount of tokens that have been emitted so far doesn't out grow `emissionSupply` which is the set max amount that would be minted through emission.
```solidity
 function emitTokens() external returns (uint256 amount) {
    amount = calculateEmission();
    require(amount > 0, "Emission: no tokens to emit");

    totalEmittedAmount += amount;

    emit TokensEmitted(emissionTarget, amount);
    mentoToken.mint(emissionTarget, amount);
  }

```

Now this causes 2 issues:
1. The `emissionSupply` that was set in Emission.sol during deployment isn't enforced, so the `emissionSupply` is useless as `totalEmittedAmount` can become bigger than it.

2. There will be reverts in `Emission.calculateEmission()` whenever positiveAggregate  is < negativeAggregate due to `totalEmittedAmount` being bigger than `emissionSupply`
```solidity
// Avoiding underflow in case the scheduled amount is bigger than the total supply
    if (positiveAggregate < negativeAggregate) {
      return emissionSupply - totalEmittedAmount;
    }
```
## Impact
1. `totalEmittedAmount` can become bigger than `emissionSupply`
2.  There will be reverts in `Emission.calculateEmission()` whenever positiveAggregate  is < negativeAggregate due to underflows

## Recommendation
Enforce `totalEmittedAmount` to always be within `emissionSupply` in  Emission.emitTokens()
