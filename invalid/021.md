# `Emission::emitTokens` Potential Loss of Tokens as tokens can be minted by any user to the old `emissionTarget` address which might no longer be intended by the protocol owner

## Summary
Any user can trigger the function `emitTokens` in the `Emission.sol` contract, which has no harm until and unless protocol team intends to change the `emissionTarget` address (which they had set previously) to a new emissionTarget address through the function `setEmissionTarget` which can be called only by `onlyOwner` but the attacker can always calls `emitTokens` function before the new emission target is updated by the owner, here tokens will be minted to the old address (which was not intended by the protocol in this type of scenario)

## Vulnerability Detail
#### Vulnerability Scenario -  
1. Protocol team deploys the Emission contract and sets an initial emissionTarget address.
2. Over time, tokens are emitted to the emissionTarget address by calling emitTokens.
3. The protocol team decides to change the emissionTarget to a new address and prepares to call setEmissionTarget.
4. Before the protocol team can update the target, an attacker notices the intent to change and quickly calls emitTokens.
5. Tokens are emitted to the old emissionTarget address, contrary to the protocol team's intentions.

Emission.sol -
```solidity
  function emitTokens() external returns (uint256 amount) {
    amount = calculateEmission();
    require(amount > 0, "Emission: no tokens to emit");

    totalEmittedAmount += amount;

    emit TokensEmitted(emissionTarget, amount);
    mentoToken.mint(emissionTarget, amount);
  }

```
```solidity
  function setEmissionTarget(address emissionTarget_) external onlyOwner {
    // slither-disable-next-line missing-zero-check
    emissionTarget = emissionTarget_;
    emit EmissionTargetSet(emissionTarget_);
  }
```


MentoToken.sol -
```solidity 
  function mint(address target, uint256 amount) external {
    require(msg.sender == emission, "MentoToken: only emission contract");
    require(emittedAmount + amount <= emissionSupply, "MentoToken: emission supply exceeded");

    emittedAmount += amount;
    _mint(target, amount);
  }
```

## Impact
Tokens that were supposed to be emitted to a new `emissionTarget` address are instead emitted to the old `emissionTarget` address, potentially resulting in a loss of tokens or misallocation of tokens within the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement access control on the `emitTokens` function to ensure that only authorized entities can trigger the emission process.
