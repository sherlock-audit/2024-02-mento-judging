# A staker withdraws funds during a migration and keeps their voting power and rewards while having nothing at stake

## Summary

The contract `Locking.sol` allows a staker to withdraw their locked funds during the contract migration,
which are otherwise not available for withdrawal outside of the migration window. Once the migration is over,
the staker has nothing at stake, whereas the delegate is still having their voting power during the locked period.

## Vulnerability Detail

Consider the following scenario for the minimal cliff and slope periods of 1 week:

 1. Bob locks 10000000 with cliff = 1 and slope = 1, delegating to Eve.
 1. Eve immediately gets 193241 votes. Bob is not allowed to withdraw yet.
 1. The administrator begins a migration by calling `Locking.stop()`.
 1. Bob is allowed to withdraw their funds and they do it via `Locking.withdraw()`.
 1. The administrator ends the migration by calling `Locking.start()`.
 1. Bob has no funds locked, yet Eve is still having 193241 votes.
 1. Bob locks 10000000 with cliff = 1 and slope = 1 again, delegating to Eve.
 1. Eve has 386482 votes.

## Impact

This vulnerability compromises the voting power mechanism and the governance protocol. For instance, the staker
could lock the retrieved funds once again and, by doing so, double their voting power. If the staker locked their
funds for the maximal period of two years and withdrew them during the migration period, it would take long for the
voting power to clean up. Most likely, this would require another contract upgrade.

## Tool used

Manual Review, forge and cast

## Recommendation

I see two approaches to mitigate this issue:

 1. Do not let stakers withdraw their funds between `stop()` and `start()`.
 1. If a staker withdraws their funds while the contract is stopped, remove all locked
    lines owned by the staker.
