# Governance voting doesn't take veMento stopped into account

## Summary

The veMento token can be stopped by admins which allow users to withdraw their whole balance. Currently the governance doesn't take it into account and thus users could still be able to vote.
This is an issue as a user that staked at max ratio before the veMento is stopped will have max voting power to influence a vote and then can instantly withdraw everything.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [`stop()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-mento/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/governance/locking/Locking.sol#L41) function can be called by the owner of the locking contract to stop the locking process and allow all users to withdraw their mento.

But the function [`getPastVotes()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-mento/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/governance/locking/LockingVotes.sol#L26) called by governance to determine voting power doesn't take this into account, it will keep returning the voting power while other functions like [`balanceOf()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-mento/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/governance/locking/Locking.sol#L191) will return 0.

This could be an issue because if a users that locked at max ratio before the lock stopped are able to vote and then instantly withdraw they could go rogue and vote for harming proposals.

An attack scenario could be a user locking and proposing a harming proposal right before the lock is stopped, then he can vote and withdraw to sell his tokens and potentially profit if the proposal is not vetoed on time.

## Impact

Medium. While it seems unlikely that the governance stops the lock without setting proper protection before, it is important that users are not able to vote when it happens.

## Recommendation

Override the [`getPastVotes()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-mento/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/governance/locking/LockingVotes.sol#L26) in the Locking.sol to return 0 or revert when the lock is stopped.
