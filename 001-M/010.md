# User's delegate line in veMento is not updated when user withdraws

## Summary
When user withdraw Mento tokens from locked contract, their delegate account's line is not updated. Which may cause delegate users have more voting power than they are supposed to have.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the governance, holders of Mento token are required to lock their tokens to gain veMento tokens and voting power. In `Locking.sol`, it allows users to lock their Mento tokens and select delegate address for the correspond voting power, upon token transfer, a new line is added to keep track of users' balance and voting power info. 

Users are also allowed to withdraw from `Locking.sol`, which they get their Mento tokens in return, and losing that part of the voting power. However, as we can see in the withdraw function:

```solidity
  function withdraw() external {
    uint96 value = getAvailableForWithdraw(msg.sender);
    if (value > 0) {
      accounts[msg.sender].amount = accounts[msg.sender].amount - (value);
      // slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-events
      require(token.transfer(msg.sender, value), "transfer failed");
    }
    emit Withdraw(msg.sender, value);
  }
```

Where `accounts[msg.sender].amount` value is correctly deducted but not delegate address. When tokens are locked, `addLines` will add balance info to account and delegate address:

```solidity
  function addLines(
    address account,
    address _delegate,
    uint96 amount,
    uint32 slopePeriod,
    uint32 cliff,
    uint32 time,
    uint32 currentBlock
  ) internal {
    require(slopePeriod <= amount, "Wrong value slopePeriod");
    updateLines(account, _delegate, time);
    (uint96 stAmount, uint96 stSlope) = getLock(amount, slopePeriod, cliff);
    LibBrokenLine.Line memory line = LibBrokenLine.Line(time, stAmount, stSlope, cliff);
    totalSupplyLine.addOneLine(counter, line, currentBlock);
    accounts[_delegate].balance.addOneLine(counter, line, currentBlock);
    {
      uint96 slope = divUp(amount, slopePeriod);
      line = LibBrokenLine.Line(time, amount, slope, cliff);
    }
    accounts[account].locked.addOneLine(counter, line, currentBlock);
    locks[counter].account = account;
    locks[counter].delegate = _delegate;
  }
```

Which `accounts[_delegate].balance.addOneLine(counter, line, currentBlock);` sets the voting power. As the voting power is determined by: 

```solidity
  function getVotes(address account) external view override returns (uint256) {
    uint32 currentBlock = getBlockNumber();
    uint32 currentWeek = roundTimestamp(currentBlock);
    return accounts[account].balance.actualValue(currentWeek, currentBlock);
  }
```

Since voting power decreases overtime, and those unlocked tokens will be safe to withdraw. But in the case of the protocol is stopped for some reason, an user can withdraw all the locked tokens:

```solidity
  function getAvailableForWithdraw(address account) public view returns (uint96) {
    uint96 value = accounts[account].amount;
    if (!stopped) {
      uint32 currentBlock = getBlockNumber();
      uint32 time = roundTimestamp(currentBlock);
      uint96 bias = accounts[account].locked.actualValue(time, currentBlock);
      value = value - (bias);
    }
    return value;
  }
```

This makes user's voting power suddenly goes to zero. But their delegate's line is not updated, which will make them still being able to hold the voting powers before withdraw.

 
## Impact
Users can still have voting powers after withdrawing all locked tokens from the `Locking.sol` contract.


## Code Snippet
```solidity
  function withdraw() external {
    uint96 value = getAvailableForWithdraw(msg.sender);
    if (value > 0) {
      accounts[msg.sender].amount = accounts[msg.sender].amount - (value);
      // slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-events
      require(token.transfer(msg.sender, value), "transfer failed");
    }
    emit Withdraw(msg.sender, value);
  }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update lines also when user withdraws.
