# Participation to Governance Without Having a Lock is Possible by Taking Advantage of stop() Call

## Summary
Users who calls withdraw() during locking stop period, will be able to continue participating to governance action without even having a lock.
## Vulnerability Detail
Locking contract have following functions in order to stop/start the system temporarily:
```solidity
  /**
   * @notice Stops the locking functionality
   * @dev Can only be called by the owner while locking is active (meaning not stopped)
   */
  function stop() external onlyOwner notStopped {
    stopped = true;
    emit StopLocking(msg.sender);
  }

  /**
   * @notice Restarts the locking functionality after it has been stopped
   * @dev Can only be called by the owner while locking is stopped
   */
  function start() external onlyOwner isStopped {
    stopped = false;
    emit StartLocking(msg.sender);
  }
```
This function prevent calls to "lock()" and "delegateTo()" functions. Hence restrict users from updating their BrokenLine's. 
Now let's look at the withdraw functionality:
```solidity
  /**
   * @notice Withdraws unlocked tokens for the caller
   */
  function withdraw() external {
    uint96 value = getAvailableForWithdraw(msg.sender);
    if (value > 0) {
      accounts[msg.sender].amount = accounts[msg.sender].amount - (value);
      // slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-events
      require(token.transfer(msg.sender, value), "transfer failed");
    }
    emit Withdraw(msg.sender, value);
  }

  /**
   * @notice Calculates the amount available for withdrawal by an account
   * @param account The account to check the withdrawable amount for
   * @return The amount of tokens available for withdrawal
   */
  function getAvailableForWithdraw(address account) public view returns (uint96) {
    uint96 value = accounts[account].amount;
    if (!stopped) { 
      uint32 currentBlock = getBlockNumber();
      uint32 time = roundTimestamp(currentBlock);
      uint96 bias = accounts[account].locked.actualValue(time, currentBlock);
      value = value - (bias);
    }
    return value;
  }
```
As we can see, getAvailableForWithdraw() function reduct bias from value only if contract is not stopped. If contract is stopped, users will be able to withdraw their whole amount that they have locked, and their BrokenLine's won't even be updated. Hence when the contract starts to operate normally again with start() call, users who used this stop period to withdraw all their funds, will be able to continue participating to governance because lines are not updated. 

## Impact
Users who withdrawn their tokens during stop period, will still be able to vote which broke accounting in governance system.

## Recommendation
Either update lines(lock) when users withdraw their tokens during stop period, or more reasonable choice is, prevent users from withdrawing when Locking is stopped since this is a period locks are fixed and can't change.
